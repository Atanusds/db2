what is data? what is dabase? what is dbms?
MySQL vs SQL vs noSQL
doqnload and installed mySQL server , workbench,shell

create a database:
   create database databases-name
use the database
  use database-name
drop database
 drop database database-name

A database contains 4 things:
 1. tables: tables stores the data in rows and columns
    rows also called as records
    columns also called as fields
 2. views: views are used to store the result of a query
 3. stored procedures: these stored procedure are used to reuse a specific query
4. functions: functions are also used for reusability but functions can return value and also can be used for business logic

-- to create table understand data types:
-- INT - normal numbers
-- Decimal - Decimal(total digits,after decimal)
-- Decimal(10,2)- 555.313
-- char(length) - char is used to stor fixed length of string
-- char(1) -- 'M','F','X'
-- varchar(15) -- without any fixed length of string
-- date -- date is used to store date in YYYY-MM-DD
-- format
-- time -- time is used to store time in HH:MM:SS
-- format
-- timestamp means time and date combined
-- create table table_name (
-- column_1 datatype,
-- column_2 datatype, column3 datatype constraints);
-- create table customers(
-- customer_id INT auto_increment primary key,
-- first_name varchar(100),
-- last_name varchar(100),
-- age INT,
-- country varchar(100)
-- ); 
-- create table if not exists orders( order_id INT Primary key,
-- item varchar(100), amount INT, 
-- customer_id INT,
-- foreign key(customer_id) 
-- references customers(customer_id)
-- );

-- desc customers;
-- insert into customers values(101, "raj","shekhar",25,"USA");
 insert into customers (first_name,last_name,age,country) values 
 ("ravi","shankar",53,"INDIA"),
 ("john","doe",45,"UK"),
 ("mary","kom",55,"INDIA"),
 ("saddam","hussain",99,"AFGAN");
 
 -- create a data base, use it and create a table books with fileds
 -- book_id, book_name,author,price,issue_date
 -- insert atleast 3 records of values
 
 -- add a column to already created table
 -- alter table customers
 -- add column ph_no INT ;
 -- to delete a column of table
  -- alter table customers
 -- drop column ph_no ;
 -- to add column after specific column
 -- alter table customers
 -- add column ph_no INT after last_name
  -- add column ph_no INT after last_name
 -- add column ph_no INT after last_name


-- insert into customers(ph_no) values(1111),(2222),(3333),(4444),(5555);
-- rename the column or change the column datatype
-- alter table customers
-- change column ph_no  phnno INT
-- rename the table
-- rename table customers to cust;
-- add a column , issue_person (number)
-- change the position of issue_person to after author
-- change issue_person data type to varchar
-- rename the table
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 





ALL commands in MYSQL are divided into differenct categories.
DML(data manipulation language): these commands are used to manipulate the data within the tables
eg: select, insert, delete, update
DDL(data definition langugae):  these commands are used to define the data within the tables
eg: create, drop,modify,alter,truncate 
DCL(data control language): these commands are used to control the data
eg: grant, revoke
TCL(transmission/transaction control language): these commands are used to control the transaction
eg:save,commit,rollback etc..,


DML(Data Manipulation Language)
select: select is used to select  and displays rows from a table,
from : from contains the tables we are using in the query
where : where is used to specify a condition so that result rows will be filtered based on the condition
  -- we can use multiple operators in the where
   i. equality(=)
   ii. greater than(>)
   iii.<
   iv. >=
   v. <=
   vi. <>
   vii. in (value1,value2,value3...) : select the rows with specified field values is in the values set given
  viii. between value1 and value2 : it returns set of values between val1 and value2
   ix. like '%x' :  like is used for similarity
    % means anything including nothing but _ means only one character

UPDATE:
update is used to update a specific values/value using a condition
update table-name
set column-name=value
where condition

Delete:
Delete is used to delete a specific row or all rows based on a condition
delete from table-name where condition

Aggregate Functions:
Aggregate functions are the default functions available in MySQL which are used to get diveresed filtered data
count: count is used to count the no.of rows 
select count(column-name/*) from table-name
we can also finct ditinct elements by adding distinct clause to the column-name
max:
max(column-name) from table-name is used to find the maximum value in that particular column
min:
min(column-name) from table-name is used to find the minimum value in that particular column
sum:
sum(column-name) from table-name is used to find the sum of all values in that particular column
avg:avg(column-name) from table-name is used to find the average of all values in that particular column
group-concat: concatenates values from multiples rows into single row.

Group By:  group by clause groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, we will use this mostly with aggregate functions
